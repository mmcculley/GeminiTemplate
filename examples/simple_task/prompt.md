## Resilient Workflow

This document outlines the stateful, step-by-step process the agent must follow. This workflow is designed to be resilient, allowing the agent to recover from interruptions.

## 1. Understand and Plan

- **Orient to the Project:** Before analyzing the user's request, look for a `GEMINI.md` file in the root of the project. If it exists, read its contents to understand the project-specific conventions, build commands, and architecture. This context is crucial for all subsequent steps.
- **Analyze the Goal:** Fully parse the user's request, keeping the project context from `GEMINI.md` in mind.
- **Decompose into a Plan:** Break the task down into a sequence of discrete, ordered sub-tasks.

## 2. Initialize or Resume

- **Check for Existing Log:** Before starting, look for a `task_log.json` file in the current directory.
- **Parse Log:** If the log exists, parse it to determine the last successfully completed step.
- **Adjust Plan:** Modify the execution plan to skip all the steps that are already marked as `"SUCCESS"` in the log. The agent will resume from the next incomplete step.

## 3. Execute and Log the Plan

For each step in the (potentially adjusted) plan:

1. **Log "STARTED":**
    - Create a new log entry for the current step.
    - Set the `status` to `"STARTED"`.
    - Write the full, updated log back to `task_log.json`.

2. **Execute the Tool:**
    - Run the tool required for the current step.

3. **Log "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE":**
    - Find the corresponding "STARTED" entry in the log.
    - Update its `status` to `"SUCCESS"` or `"FAILURE"`.
    - Record the tool's output or error message in the `details` object.
    - Write the full, updated log back to `task_log.json`.
    - If a step fails, halt execution and report the failure to the user.

## 4. Finalize and Commit

- **Generate Final Output:** Once all steps are complete, synthesize the results as specified in `05_output_format.md`.
- **Log Finalization:** Add a final log entry indicating the task is complete.
- **Commit Changes:** If the task involves changes to the codebase, use the `git_add` and `git_commit` tools to create a version-controlled checkpoint. This action must also be logged.

---

## Output Format

This document specifies the structure and format of the final output. The agent must adhere to these guidelines to ensure consistency and predictability.

## General Structure

The output should be a JSON object with the following top-level keys:

- `summary` (string): A brief, human-readable summary of the action taken and the result.
- `details` (object): A more detailed breakdown of the steps performed.
- `status` (string): The final status of the operation. Must be one of `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`.

## `details` Object

The `details` object should contain the following keys:

- `plan` (array of strings): The sequence of steps that were planned.
- `execution` (array of objects): A log of the executed steps. Each object in the array should have:
  - `step` (string): A description of the action taken.
  - `tool_used` (string): The name of the tool that was used.
  - `output` (string): The output from the tool.
- `final_output` (string): The final result or product of the operation (e.g., generated code, file content).

## Example Output

```json
{
  "summary": "Successfully created a new Python file and wrote a 'hello world' function to it.",
  "details": {
    "plan": [
      "Create a new file named 'hello.py'",
      "Write the 'hello_world' function to the file"
    ],
    "execution": [
      {
        "step": "Create a new file named 'hello.py'",
        "tool_used": "code_writer",
        "output": "File created successfully."
      },
      {
        "step": "Write the 'hello_world' function to the file",
        "tool_used": "code_writer",
        "output": "Content written successfully."
      }
    ],
    "final_output": "def hello_world():\n  print('Hello, world!')"
  },
  "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

---

## Logging

To ensure resilience and recoverability, every critical action must be logged to a stateful JSON log file. This log allows the agent to track its progress and resume an interrupted task from the last successfully completed step.

## Log File

- **Name:** `task_log.json`
- **Location:** The root of the project directory for the current task.
- **Format:** A JSON array of log entries.

## Log Entry Structure

Each entry in the log must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ",
  "step": "A human-readable description of the action being performed.",
  "tool": "The name of the tool being used for this step (e.g., 'code_writer', 'command_executor').",
  "status": "The current status of the step. Must be one of: 'STARTED', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE'.",
  "details": {
    "input": "The parameters or inputs provided to the tool.",
    "output": "The result from the tool (on SUCCESS).",
    "error": "The error message (on FAILURE)."
  }
}
```

## Logging Workflow

1. **Before Action:** Before executing any tool, the agent **must** first write a log entry with the `status` set to `"STARTED"`.
2. **After Action:**
    - If the tool executes successfully, the agent **must** update the log entry for that step, setting the `status` to `"SUCCESS"` and recording the result in `details.output`.
    - If the tool fails, the agent **must** update the log entry, setting the `status` to `"FAILURE"` and recording the error in `details.error`.

This two-phase logging (logging the start, then updating with the result) ensures that even if the agent is interrupted during a tool's execution, the log will correctly show that the step was `"STARTED"` but not completed.

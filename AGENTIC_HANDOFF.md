### Guest RSVP Flow
- The user receives a unique link to the event's RSVP page.
- The page displays event details (name, date, location) and a form to enter their name, email, and attendance status.
- Upon submission, the user sees a confirmation message and receives a confirmation email.

### Host Dashboard Layout
- After logging in, the host sees a dashboard with a list of their created events.
- Each event card shows the event name, date, and a summary of RSVP counts (Attending, Maybe, Not Attending).
- There is a prominent "Create New Event" button.

### Event Builder Wizard
- A multi-step wizard guides the host through creating a new event.
- **Step 1:** Basic Info (Event Name, Date, Time, Location).
- **Step 2:** Details (Description, Dress Code).
- **Step 3:** RSVP Options (Collect names, meal choices, etc.).
- **Step 4:** Review and Confirm.

### Check-in Screen
- A simple interface for hosts to check in guests on the day of the event.
- It features a search bar to find guests by name and a button to mark them as "Checked-in".

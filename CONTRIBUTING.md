## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a problem, please check the [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/gemini-prompt-template/issues) page to see if your issue has already been reported. If not, please open a new issue and provide as much detail as possible, including:

- A clear and descriptive title.

- Your operating system and any relevant version numbers.

## Suggesting Enhancements

## Git Configuration and Commit Strategy

To ensure a clean and understandable project history, it's crucial to configure Git correctly and follow a consistent commit strategy.

### Local Git Configuration

Before making any commits, please configure your local repository with your name and email. This information is embedded into your commits.

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Set your name for this repository
git config user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email for this repository
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Commit Granularity and Style

- **Make small, frequent commits.** Each commit should represent a single, logical change.
- **Write clear and concise commit messages.** A good commit message should be able to stand on its own. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. For example:
  - `feat: Add interactive mode to assembly script`
  - `fix: Correct pathing error in Windows build script`
  - `docs: Update README with new workflow`

Thank you for your contribution!

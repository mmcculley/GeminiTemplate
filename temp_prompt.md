## Resilient Workflow

This document outlines the stateful, step-by-step process the agent must follow. This workflow is designed to be resilient, allowing the agent to recover from interruptions.

## 1. Understand and Plan

- **Orient to the Project:** Before analyzing the user's request, look for a `GEMINI.md` and `AGENTIC_HANDOFF.md` file in the root of the project. If they exist, read their contents to understand the project-specific conventions, build commands, and architecture. This context is crucial for all subsequent steps.
- **Analyze the Goal:** Fully parse the user's request, keeping the project context from the markdown files in mind.
- **Decompose into a Plan:** Break the task down into a sequence of discrete, ordered sub-tasks.

## 2. Initialize or Resume

- **Check for Existing Log:** Before starting, look for the `./agent_out_logs/` directory and its contents, specifically `progression_status.md` and `agent_state.json`.
- **Parse Log:** If the logs exist, parse them to determine the last successfully completed step.
- **Adjust Plan:** Modify the execution plan to skip all the steps that are already marked as complete. The agent will resume from the next incomplete step.
- **Log Resumption:** Before continuing, write a checkpoint entry in `progression_status.md`: `[RESTART] Resuming after failure at step: <X>. Verified existing file state.`

## 3. Execute and Log the Plan (Dual Logging)

For each step in the (potentially adjusted) plan, you will perform **dual logging** to maintain both human-readable and machine-readable records.

1. **Sanity Checks:** Before major steps, perform sanity checks as defined in `GEMINI.md`. If a check fails, log the error to `completion_summary.md` and halt.

2. **Log "STARTED":** Before executing any tool, you must log the start of the action in **both** places:
    - **Human Log:** Write a log entry to `progression_status.md` indicating the step is about to start.
    - **Machine Log:** Append a new JSON object to `task_log.json` with the `status` field set to `"STARTED"`.

3. **Execute the Tool:** Run the tool required for the current step.

4. **Log "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE":** After execution, you must update the logs in **both** places:
    - **On Success:**
        - **Human Log:** Update `progression_status.md` and `scaffold_coverage.md`.
        - **Machine Log:** Update the corresponding entry in `task_log.json`, setting `status` to `"SUCCESS"` and recording the result.
    - **On Failure:**
        - **Human Log:** Update `progression_status.md` and `completion_summary.md` with the error.
        - **Machine Log:** Update the corresponding entry in `task_log.json`, setting `status` to `"FAILURE"` and recording the error message.
    - **Stateful Files:** Update `agent_state.json` and `file_fingerprints.json` after every meaningful block of work.

## 4. Finalize and Commit

- **Generate Final Output:** Once all steps are complete, synthesize the results and update all logs.
- **Final Checklist:** Confirm that all MVP files and folders from `AGENTIC_HANDOFF.md` exist.
- **Create Completion Flag:** If successful, write the `✔️ partyvenue_planner_build_complete.flag` file at the project root.

## Logging (Dual System)

To ensure maximum resilience and observability, this project uses a dual logging system. Every critical action must be logged to **both** a human-readable directory of files and a machine-readable JSON log.

---

### 1. Human-Readable Logs (`agent_out_logs/`)

This directory provides a high-level, easily reviewable summary of the agent's progress and state.

#### Log Directory

- **Name:** `agent_out_logs/`
- **Location:** The root of the project directory for the current task.

#### Log Files

| Filename | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `completion_summary.md` | Summary of the current run’s scaffold or changes. |
| `agent_state.json` | The agent's current state, including decisions and focus. |
| `file_fingerprints.json` | Hashes or identifiers of all created/edited files. |
| `scaffold_coverage.md` | A summary of which handoff requirements are complete. |
| `progression_status.md` | A timeline or step-by-step log of progression. |

---

### 2. Machine-Readable Log (`task_log.json`)

This file provides a detailed, structured log suitable for automated parsing and resumption.

#### Log File

- **Name:** `task_log.json`
- **Location:** The root of the project directory for the current task.
- **Format:** A JSON array of log entries.

#### Log Entry Structure

Each entry in the log must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ",
  "step": "A human-readable description of the action being performed.",
  "tool": "The name of the tool being used for this step (e.g., 'code_writer', 'command_executor').",
  "status": "The current status of the step. Must be one of: 'STARTED', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE'.",
  "details": {
    "input": "The parameters or inputs provided to the tool.",
    "output": "The result from the tool (on SUCCESS).",
    "error": "The error message (on FAILURE)."
  }
}
```

---

*The workflow component will specify exactly when and how to write to each of these logs.*

---

Your mission is to build a complete scaffold for a modular event management web application called PartyVenue Planner, based on the provided AGENTIC_HANDOFF.md and GEMINI.md files. The app includes a React + Shoelace frontend and an Express + PostgreSQL backend, fully dockerized.
